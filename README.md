# Determination-of-the-optimal-number-of-strata-for-propensity-score-subclassification
This repository stores a determination method of the optimal number of strata for propensity score subclassification proposed by Orihara and Hamada (2021).

This is a function for the propensity score subclassification estimator (see Orihara and Hamada, 2021).
Please prepare a propensity score estimator.

TT: treatment variable, PS: propensity score, YY: outcome variable

<Limitations>
Treatment variables are only dichotomous.
The maximum number of strata is necessary to use the method.

<Caution>
The programs has not validated correctly such as double programming (there is only self check).
The programs are freely available; however, there are no responsibility.
